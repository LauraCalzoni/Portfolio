# Optimal Control of an aircraft model in Python

Considered a nonlinear, discretized model of an aircraft, Newtonâ€™s algorithm has been implemented to compute the optimal trajectory to follow. A LQR controller has been tuned to track the optimal trajectory. Also some physical limits are taken into account, regarding  the absolute values of the pitch moment and thrust force.
