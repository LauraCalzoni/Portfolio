# 1. Estimation of an unknown linear model 

Adoption of the Weighted Recursive Least Square IV method to get a consistent estimate of the model's parameters, with an initial offline batch estimate. Application of the MDL algorithm to estimate the correct model order. Model validation through the whiteness test.

# 2. Binary Classification problem with nonlinear boundary

Nonlinear transformation of the input space applied in order to build a Logistic Regression model. Newton Raphson iterative algorithm used as solver.
