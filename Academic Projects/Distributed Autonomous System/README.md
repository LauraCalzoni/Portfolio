# 1. Distributed Classification via Neural Networks

Distributed training of a custom NN for the classification of the image dataset fashion_mnist. The problem is faced firstly approaching to a general consensus optimization problem, then realizing a (simpler) centralize training and concluding realizing its distributed version. The distributed training is based on the Gradient Tracking method. 


# 2. Distributed Control for multi-robot systems in ROS2

Implementation of a distributed realization for potential-based Formation Control. The algorithm must include a solution for avoiding collisions between agents and/or obstacles, as well as a control design in order to steer the formation toward different target positions or trajectories. The effectiveness of the implemented algorithm is tested for multiple desired 3D formations, with a different number of agents.
