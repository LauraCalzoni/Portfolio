# Depth map estimation in Stereo Vision

Computation of the disparity maps associated to pairs of already rectified stereo images. A local, area-based algorithm employing the SAD has been firstly used. Typical drawbacks (as occlusions, non frontal-parallel surfaces, low textured regions, depth discontinuities, boundary overreach and insufficient intensity variations in the pictures) are addressed through the use of different techniques like Left-Right consistency check, postfiltering and rejection of ambiguous matches.
