Hi professor,

this is just a note to explain how the files are organized. 
We have realized several IPYNB files as our project requires to follow different steps. 
The first one to check is the Base_algorithm_project which contains the mandatory part. 
The others implement multiple optional parts that are independent of each other. As a consequence, there is not a proper order. 
Anyway, if you would like to follow the code as it is presented in the report, the order of the files is the following:
I) LR_project
II) Minimum_selection_project
III) Project_with_ZNCC
IV) Project_with_filters(Bilateral+NLM)
V) Project_Postfilter
Finally, we have made a final code (Complete_project) putting together all the good parts that actually improved our baseline algorithm.
This one should be the last one to look at. 

Thanks a lot!
